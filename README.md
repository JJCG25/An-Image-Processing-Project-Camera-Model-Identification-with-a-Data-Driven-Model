## Overview

This repository contains the source code and trained models for the project titled **"Camera Model Identification with a Data-Driven Model"**. The goal of the project is to classify the smartphone brand or model that captured a digital image using convolutional neural networks.

The project implements two main strategies:
1. Replication of a CNN architecture proposed by [Baroffio *et al.*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301841474_Camera_identification_with_deep_convolutional_networks) for identifying traditional camera models.
2. Fine-tuning of a pre-trained EfficientNetV2-M model on a smartphone image dataset (FloreView) for brand-level classification.

The model achieves a validation accuracy of **82%** on the FloreView dataset and is available through a simple web [interface](https://jjcg25.github.io).

A detailed explanation of the methodology and results can be found in the [final paper (PDF)](Camera_Model_Identification_with_a_Data-Driven_Model.pdf).

## Datasets

- **Training 1:** [Dresden Image Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/micscodes/dresden-image-database)
- **Training 2:** [FloreView Dataset](https://lesc.dinfo.unifi.it/FloreView/) â€“ smartphone images acquired under controlled conditions.

## Model Options

The project includes two model implementations:

- `CameraConvNet`: Custom CNN from Baroffio *et al.*, trained from scratch and later fine-tuned on smartphone images.
- `EfficientNetV2_M`: Pre-trained on ImageNet and fully fine-tuned on the FloreView dataset for mobile camera classification.

ðŸ”— **Download Trained Models**  
You can download the `.pth` files for both models from the following Google Drive folder:
